// PLACING OF EACH PLAYERS CARD 


- Higher card takes both cards

- Cards place to bottom of winner's stack

- tie **WAR**

- each player places 3 face down

- Each place one face up

- Higher card takes whole pot

- If tie, repeat until no tie

- Person loses all cards

  - maybe a listener or function calling for when players cards array reaches 0

**Things to remember**

- count each round of hands, including war rounds

- ace is high, so set correct placement of index

- if one person is not able to finish a round of war because they dont have enough cards then they lose
