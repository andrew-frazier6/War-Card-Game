## ROADMAP

- Even though the game was designed to be played in the console, I look forward to the opportunity when I make it into a User friendly interface game.

## FINAL FEELINGS

- I am happy with the progression of the game, though not fully satisfied. I learned so much through looping and conditionals that it forced me to step away and think through my steps. Soon enough I look forward to cleaning up a lot of my code to make it as DRY as possible.
