- Play the game in console https://andrew-frazier6.github.io/project-4-hangman/

## ABOUT

- The game was built with Javascript, HTML, CSS. It was designed to be played ONLY in the conosle.

## INSTRUCTIONS

- Click the "lets play" and watch to see whether player 1 or player 2 wins!

## GAME RULES

- A shuffled deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards. Each player places their stack of cards face down, in front of them.

- War Card Game


**Steps for making game**

- Build the deck

- Shuffle the deck

- Split the Deck

- Each person gets half shuffled deck 

- Each person places down one card

- Higher card takes both cards

- Cards place to bottom of winner's stack

- tie **WAR**

- each player places 3 face down

- Each place one face up

- Higher card takes whole pot

- If tie, repeat until no tie

- Person loses all cards

  - maybe a listener or function calling for when players cards array reaches 0

**Things to remember**

- count each round of hands, including war rounds (if possible to conceptualize)

- ace is high, so set correct placement of index

- if one person is not able to finish a round of war because they dont have enough cards then they lose

- Each player turns up one card at the same time and the player with the higher card wins. The winner then takes both cards and puts them on the bottom of his stack.

<<<<<<< HEAD
- If there is no winner and each rank of the cards are the same, it is called War. Each player takes out 4 cards. Players compare the rank of the 4th card. Higher card wins and receives all the cards. If there is another tie, the process continues until winner.

- END GAME. The game continues out copmaring cards and playing war until one player has all 52 cards in their stack.

## ROADMAP

- Even though the game was designed to be played in the console, I look forward to the opportunity when I make it into a User friendly interface game.

## FINAL FEELINGS

- I am happy with the progression of the game, though not fully satisfied. I learned so much through looping and conditionals that it forced me to step away and think through my steps. Soon enough I look forward to cleaning up a lot of my code to make it as DRY as possible.
