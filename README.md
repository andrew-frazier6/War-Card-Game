## WAR CARD GAME

- Play the game in console https://andrew-frazier6.github.io/project-4-hangman/

## ABOUT

- The game was built with Javascript, HTML, CSS. It was designed to be played ONLY in the conosle.

## INSTRUCTIONS

- Click the "lets play" and watch to see whether player 1 or player 2 wins!

## GAME RULES

- A shuffled deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards. Each player places their stack of cards face down, in front of them.

- Each player turns up one card at the same time and the player with the higher card wins. The winner then takes both cards and puts them on the bottom of his stack.

- If there is no winner and each rank of the cards are the same, it is called War. Each player takes out 4 cards. Players compare the rank of the 4th card. Higher card wins and receives all the cards. If there is another tie, the process continues until winner.

- END GAME. The game continues out copmaring cards and playing war until one player has all 52 cards in their stack.

## ROADMAP

- Even though the game was designed to be played in the console, I look forward to the opportunity when I make it into a User friendly interface game.

## FINAL FEELINGS

- I am happy with the progression of the game, though not fully satisfied. I learned so much through looping and conditionals that it forced me to step away and think through my steps. Soon enough I look forward to cleaning up a lot of my code to make it as DRY as possible.
